	### `yarn start`

	Runs the app in the development mode.\
	Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

	The page will reload when you make changes.\
	You may also see any lint errors in the console.

	### `npm test`

	Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

	### `npm run build`

	Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
	It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
